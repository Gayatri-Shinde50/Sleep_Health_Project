# Summary:

This dataset analysis highlights significant correlations between sleep quality, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular health across different demographics and occupations. Key findings include:

Sleep Disorders: Sleep disorders, including insomnia and sleep apnea, are prevalent among various demographic groups. Females, particularly those aged 50-59, have a high prevalence of sleep apnea (87%), while a significant proportion of males (53%) suffer from insomnia. Sleep quality varies by occupation, with Engineers, Lawyers, Nurses, Accountants, and Doctors reporting the highest sleep quality.

Physical Activity & BMI: Physical activity is strongly correlated with BMI categories. Overweight and normal weight individuals tend to walk between 6,800 and 7,000 steps per day, while obese individuals walk fewer steps (around 3,000). Heart rate, however, is influenced by more than just step count, as individuals walking more than 8,000 steps per day have a lower heart rate (72 bpm) than those with fewer steps (85 bpm). Additionally, the lifestyle of Old Adults (50-59) tends to be more active than sedentary, unlike younger adults (30-49).

Stress Levels: Stress levels vary by occupation, with men generally exhibiting higher stress levels than women. Occupations like Nurses and Sales Representatives show significant differences in stress levels and physical activity, with Nurses walking more steps daily (8,000) and Sales Representatives showing lower mobility (3,000 steps) and higher resting heart rates (85 bpm). High sleep quality correlates with lower stress levels.

Cardiovascular Health: Blood pressure measurements show common systolic/diastolic values such as 130/85, 125/80, and 140/95, indicating varied levels of cardiovascular health across individuals.

BMI Distribution: The majority of the sample falls within the normal BMI category (52%), with 40% classified as overweight and 3% as obese.
